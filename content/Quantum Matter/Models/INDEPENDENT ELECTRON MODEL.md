This model is an improvement over the free electron model as it no longer assumes that electrons are free. Instead, it considers the presence of a periodic potential, which is generated by atoms arranged in a crystalline lattice. This periodic potential, $V(\bar{r})$, reflects the repeating structure of the crystal:

$$
V(\bar{r}) = V(\bar{r} + \bar{R}_n)
$$
where $\bar{R}_n$ is a lattice translation vector:
$$
\bar{R}_n = n_1 \bar{a}_1 + n_2 \bar{a}_2 + n_3 \bar{a}_3 \quad \text{with } n_1, n_2, n_3 \in \{0, \pm1, \pm2, \dots\}
$$
Here, $\bar{a}_1, \bar{a}_2, \bar{a}_3$ are the primitive lattice vectors. The dimensions of the unit cell in terms of the primitive vectors are:

$$
L_x = a_1 \cdot N_1, \quad L_y = a_2 \cdot N_2, \quad L_z = a_3 \cdot N_3
$$

## Schrödinger Equation in a Periodic Potential

For an electron in a periodic potential, the time-independent Schrödinger equation takes the following form:

$$
- \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 \Psi(\bar{r}) + V(\bar{r}) \Psi(\bar{r}) = E \Psi(\bar{r})
$$
where $\Psi(\bar{r})$ is the wavefunction of the electron, $E$ is its energy, and $V(\bar{r})$ is the periodic potential.
## Bloch Theorem
Bloch's theorem plays a central role in solving the Schrödinger equation for electrons in a periodic potential. It states that the solutions of this equation can be written as a plane wave modulated by a periodic function:

$$
\Psi_{\bar{k}}(\bar{r}) = e^{i \bar{k} \cdot \bar{r}} \mu_{\bar{k}}(\bar{r})
$$
where:
- $\mu_{\bar{k}}(\bar{r}) = \mu_{\bar{k}}(\bar{r} + \bar{R}_n)$ is a function with the same periodicity as the crystal lattice.
- $\bar{k}$ is the wave vector associated with the electron.
We can express Bloch's theorem in an alternative form by noting that:

$$
\Psi_{\bar{k}}(\bar{r}) = e^{i \bar{k} \cdot \bar{r}} e^{i \bar{k} \cdot \bar{R}_n} \mu_{\bar{k}}(\bar{r} + \bar{R}_n)
$$

This yields the important result:

$$
\Psi_{\bar{k}}(\bar{r} + \bar{R}_n) = \Psi_{\bar{k}}(\bar{r}) e^{i \bar{k} \cdot \bar{R}_n}
$$

The usefulness of Bloch’s theorem is that it allows us to restrict the search for the solution of Schrödinger equation from the entire space to the space of periodic functions. That is, functions that were once described in the unit cell can be extended beyond it periodically.
## Quantization of $\bar{k}$

To find the allowed values of $\bar{k}$, we consider the periodic boundary conditions (PBC) along the $x$-axis. The same analysis applies to the $y$ and $z$-axes:

1) Bloch's theorem gives:
   $$
   \Psi_{\bar{k}}(\bar{r} + N_1 \bar{a}_1) = \Psi_{\bar{k}}(\bar{r}) e^{i \bar{k} \cdot (N_1 \bar{a}_1)}
   $$

2) The periodic boundary condition (PBC) requires that:
   $$
   \Psi_{\bar{k}}(\bar{r} + N_1 \bar{a}_1) = \Psi_{\bar{k}}(\bar{r})
   $$

Combining these two conditions leads to:

$$
e^{i \bar{k} \cdot (N_1 \bar{a}_1)} = 1
$$

which implies:

$$
N_1 \bar{k} \cdot \bar{a}_1 = 2 \pi n_x \quad \text{where } n_x \in \mathbb{Z}
$$

### Reciprocal Lattice Representation of $\bar{k}$

Since $\bar{k}$ belongs to the reciprocal space, we can express it as:

$$
\bar{k} = x_1 \bar{g}_1 + x_2 \bar{g}_2 + x_3 \bar{g}_3
$$

where $\bar{g}_1, \bar{g}_2, \bar{g}_3$ are the reciprocal lattice vectors defined by:

$$
\bar{a}_i \cdot \bar{g}_j = 2 \pi \delta_{ij}
$$

Substituting into the earlier condition for $\bar{k}$, we get:

$$
N_1 x_1 \cdot 2\pi = 2\pi n_x \quad \Rightarrow \quad x_1 = \frac{n_x}{N_1}
$$

Similarly, for the other directions:

$$
x_2 = \frac{n_y}{N_2}, \quad x_3 = \frac{n_z}{N_3}
$$

Thus, $\bar{k}$ can be written as:

$$
\bar{k} = \frac{n_x}{N_1} \bar{g}_1 + \frac{n_y}{N_2} \bar{g}_2 + \frac{n_z}{N_3} \bar{g}_3
$$

This defines the quantized wavevectors in the reciprocal space.

From the drawing we can see that along the $x$ direction there are $N_{1}$ allowed $\bar{k}$ vector. Since the [[RECIPROCAL LATTICE|Brillouin zone]] has the same area as the green one (which is a primitive cell of the reciprocal lattice), both of them can fit $N_{tot} = N_{1} N_{2} N_{3}$ $\bar{k}$ vectors.
## Properties of Bloch States

An important property of Bloch states is that wavefunctions differing by a reciprocal lattice vector describe the same physical state:

$$
\Psi_{\bar{k} + \bar{G}}(\bar{r}) = \Psi_{\bar{k}}(\bar{r})
$$
where $\bar{G}$ is any reciprocal lattice vector.

Consequently, the corresponding energies are also periodic in $\bar{k}$:

$$
E_{\bar{k} + \bar{G}} = E_{\bar{k}}
$$

This periodicity of the energy eigenvalues implies that the allowed energy bands are confined to the first Brillouin zone.![[Screenshot_20241016_122947.png]]
![[Screenshot_20241016_123506.png]]
In the (example) drawing above the energy bands are represented only between $- \pi / a_{1}$ and  $\pi / a_{1}$ because $E_{\bar{k}}$ is periodic.

It is important to notice that, differently from the [[FREE AND INDEPENDENT ELECTRON MODEL (FREE ELECTRON FERMI GAS MODEL)|free and independent electron model]] here the energy does not go continuously from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$ and thus the behaviour of semiconductors and insulators can be explained.

## Band Structure and Material Properties

In real crystals, the energy spectrum is not continuous as it was in the free electron model. Instead, the periodic potential causes the energy bands to split, creating gaps where no electron states exist. This behavior explains the electrical properties of different materials:

- **Metals**: Conductivity is due to partially filled bands.
- **Semiconductors and Insulators**: These materials exhibit band gaps, which prevent conduction unless electrons are thermally excited across the gap.

### Example: One Electron Per Atom
Let's consider the case of a solid made out of cells with only 1 atom with 1 electron.

We want to see:
1) if the material behaves as a metal, a semiconductor or an insulator.
2) if its properties depend on the size.
![[Screenshot_20241016_124121.png]]
Notice that the red lines in the drawing are not continuous in reality k is quantized but due to the fact that we are considering macroscopic distances, it could be approximated continuously. This show that there are only $N_{tot}$ allowed $\bar{k}$ vectors between  $- \pi / a_{1}$ and  $\pi / a_{1}$ and thus $N_{tot}$ allowed energy states (the orange dots). 
Considering that we have $N_{tot}$ electrons (1 electron in 1 atom in 1 cell) and that the Pauli exclusion principle allows 2 electrons in each state, only half of the first band is occupied.
If we were to double the size of the sample nothing would change since there would be $2N_{tot}$ electrons and $2N_{tot}$ allowed $\bar{k}$ vectors. 
The material behaves like a metal because the energy band is only half-filled.
With one electron per atom, and each energy state able to hold two electrons (due to spin), only half of the available states in the first band are occupied. This leaves many empty states just above the Fermi level. In metals, this partial filling allows electrons to easily move to nearby unoccupied states when an electric field is applied, enabling electrical conductivity.
In contrast, materials like insulators or semiconductors have fully filled bands and an energy gap, preventing this free movement of electrons at low temperatures.
