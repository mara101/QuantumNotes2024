The **Wigner-Seitz cell** is a specific type of [[BRAVAIS LATTICE AND CRYSTAL STRUCTURES|primitive cell]] in a crystal lattice. It is defined as the region of space around a lattice point that is closer to that point than to any other lattice point. In simpler terms, it is the smallest volume around a lattice point that can be replicated through translation to fill space without overlapping or leaving gaps.

Those are the representation of the lattice cell in 2 and 3 dimensions.
