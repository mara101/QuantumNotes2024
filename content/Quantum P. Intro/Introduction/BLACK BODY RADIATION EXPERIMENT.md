This is a further example of how classical physics failed to describe the new fenomena observed in the experiments at the beginning of the 20th century. The black body radiation experiment is one of those.
A **black body** is an idealized physical object that absorbs all incoming radiation without reflecting any. The radiation it emits depends solely on its temperature.
According to classical physics and the **Rayleigh-Jeans Law** the radiation is reverse tetra proportional to the wavelength that hits the black body. So if we decrease the wavelength of the radiation we should obtain an *ultraviolet catastrophe*. This predicted that an infinite amount of energy would be emitted at ultraviolet and shorter wavelengths.
### Rayleigh-Jeans Law:

$$
I(\lambda, T) = \frac{2c k_B T}{\lambda^4}
$$

Where:
- $\lambda$ is the wavelength,
- T is the temperature in Kelvin,
- c is the speed of light in a vacuum,
- $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.

## Explanation With Quantum Mechanics

To resolve the discrepancy, **Max Planck** proposed in 1900 that the energy emitted or absorbed by the oscillators (atoms or molecules) in the walls of a black body is **quantized** rather than continuous. 
$$ E = nh\nu $$
- E is the energy,
- n is an integer (1, 2, 3,...),
- h is Planck's constant, 6.62607015×10−34 J*$Hz^{-1}$ 
- $\nu$ (nu) is the inverse of $\lambda$, so $\frac{1}{\lambda} = \nu$
