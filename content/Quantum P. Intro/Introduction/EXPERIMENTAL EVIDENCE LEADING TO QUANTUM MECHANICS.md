The shift from classical to quantum mechanics began with a series of groundbreaking experiments that highlighted the limitations of classical physics and set the foundation for quantum theory. Classical physics, based on Newtonian mechanics, Maxwell's electromagnetism, and thermodynamics, was initially successful in explaining macroscopic phenomena but failed to describe the behavior of systems at microscopic scales. Several key experiments revealed the inadequacy of classical models and provided direct evidence of quantum behavior, ultimately leading to the development of quantum mechanics.
