### De Broglie Hypothesis 
In 1924 de Broglie propose in his thesis that, as the electromagnetic waves possesses point like properties, also [[CLASSICAL PARTICLE AND WAVES|particles]] could possess [[CLASSICAL PARTICLE AND WAVES|wavelike]] properties.
According to de Broglie, a wavelength can be associated with particles using the same relations that apply to photons:
$\lambda_d = \frac{h}{p}$ and $E= \hbar \omega$
where $\lambda_d$ is the de Broglie wavelength. Then the primary difference between particles and photons is the fact that photons do not possesses a mass of their own. So in classical physics we would describe the energy of a particle as $E = \frac{p^{2}}{2m}$ , but adding the effects of relativity we can still give a photon it's proper energy writing Einstein famous formulas for the energy of a particle: $$E^{2} = (pc)^{2} + (m_o c^{2})^{2}$$
Where c is the speed of light, $m_0$ is the rest mass and $p$ is the momentum. As we said the photon does not have a resting mass, so if we do not add the wavelike properties we end up with the conclusion that photons do not have energy.
But if we use de Broglie wavelength we can say that the momentum of a photon is equal to $p = \frac{h}{\lambda_d}$ and the we can say that it's energy is $E^{2} = (pc)^{2}$

### Double Slit Experiment
![[double_slit_experiment.mp4]]
The double Slit Experiment started as a conceptual experiment to explain the wavelike nature of particles. Later on this experiment was realized and gave further proofs of the double nature of particles.
The experiment is based on the [[YOUNG DOUBLE SLIT EXPERIMENT|Young Experiment]] in which are present two slits that serves as circular emitters of light waves. Young demonstrated that waves interfere with on another, creating fringes on the surface at the end of the two slits. 
If the the quantum particles behaves like waves, the we should also see fringes if we repeat the experiment, but using quantum particles such electron or photons.

In a classical representation of the phenomena we should see the two probability distribution of the particle adding with one another as the following image:

Instead we can observe fringes due to the double-nature of the particles. Even if the particle is fired one at the time, the [[WAVE FUNCTION AND IT'S STATISTICAL REPRESENTATION|probability wave]] interfere with itself creating a probability distribution that in the end create visible fringes
