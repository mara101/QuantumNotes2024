### Notes on Classical Particles and Waves

#### Classical Particles:
- In classical mechanics, **particles** are considered point-like objects with well-defined properties such as:
  - **Mass** ($m$).
  - **Position vector** $\vec{r}(t)$, which specifies their location in space at time $ t $.
  - **Velocity vector** $\vec{v}(t) = \frac{d\vec{r}(t)}{dt}$, which specifies how their position changes over time.
  
- The behavior of these particles can be predicted by solving **Newton’s equations of motion** with given initial conditions. 
  - For one-dimensional motion, this translates to using **phase space**, where a particle’s **momentum** $p = mv$ is plotted against its **position** $x$.
  
- Particles in classical mechanics follow **deterministic paths**, meaning once initial conditions are known, future behavior can be predicted accurately using Newton’s laws.

#### Classical Waves:
- A **wave** is a **periodic disturbance** that propagates through space and time, carrying **energy**.
  - Examples include **electromagnetic waves**, which consist of synchronized oscillations of electric and magnetic fields.
  - The speed of electromagnetic waves in a vacuum is the speed of light, $c$.

- Waves are classified based on their **wavefront**, the surface on which the wave has the same phase at a given time. A simple example is the **plane wave**, which has a harmonic periodic pattern and can be described by the equation:
  
  $$
  E(x, t) = E_0 \cos(kx - \omega t)
  $$
  
  where:
  - $k$ is the **wave number** related to the wavelength $\lambda$ by $k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$,
  - $\omega$ is the **angular frequency** related to the frequency $\nu$ by $\omega = 2\pi\nu$.

- **Electromagnetic waves** are typically generated by **accelerated charges** or **time-varying currents**, as described by **Maxwell’s equations**.

#### Wave Properties:
- **Interference**: When two or more waves overlap, the total displacement at any point is the sum of the displacements due to each individual wave. This can result in **constructive** or **destructive interference**.
- **Superposition principle**: The resultant wave at any point is the sum of the individual waves.

- **[[YOUNG DOUBLE SLIT EXPERIMENT|Young’s Double-Slit Experiment]]**: This classic experiment demonstrates interference patterns when a plane wave passes through two narrow slits. The observed **fringes** on a screen are a hallmark of **wave behavior**.

These concepts of **particles and waves** in classical mechanics serve as a foundation but were later challenged by quantum mechanics, which introduced **wave-particle duality**.
