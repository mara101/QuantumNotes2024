The **photoelectric effect** was one of the key experiments that challenged the classical wave theory of light and supported **Planck's hypothesis** of quantized energy.
When light illuminates a **metal surface**, electrons can be emitted from the surface. This effect was first observed by **Hertz** and was expected by classical physics as long as the energy of the radiation exceeded the **work function** ($W$) of the metal, the energy required to release electrons.

#### Classical Predictions:
1. The **maximum kinetic energy** ($K_{max}$) of the emitted electrons should depend on the **intensity** of the radiation, according to Maxwell's equations.
2. The effect should occur for **any wavelength** of radiation, provided the intensity is high enough to overcome the work function $W$.

#### Actual Observations:
1. For a **fixed wavelength**, $K_{max}$ is **independent** of the light intensity.
2. The effect does **not occur** if the frequency of the light is **below a certain threshold**.

#### Einstein’s Explanation:
- **Einstein** provided the explanation in 1905 by expanding on **Planck’s hypothesis**. He proposed that the energy of electromagnetic radiation is not spread out over the wavefront but is instead concentrated in discrete packets called **photons**.
- The energy of a photon is given by:
  
  $$E = h\nu$$
  
  where:
  - $E$ is the energy of the photon,
  - $h$ is **Planck's constant** ($6.62607015 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}$),
  - $\nu$ is the frequency of the radiation.
  
- The **kinetic energy** of the emitted electrons is given by:

  $$K_{max} = h\nu - W$$
  
  where $W$ is the **work function** of the metal. If the photon energy is lower than the work function, no electrons are emitted.


 The **photoelectric effect** demonstrated that light behaves not just as a wave but also as a particle (photon), leading to the concept of **wave-particle duality**
