In the form you have just seen of Newton's second law:
$$ m\frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = -\frac{\partial V}{\partial x}$$
the reason why the force $F$ is considered as the negative [[GRADIENT|gradient]] of the potential energy $V(x)$ is because we are considering a conservative force. A conservative force is such when the work done by that force to move the particle from A to B is always the same and does not depends on the path done by the force. 
In physics systems tends to move to a place where the potential energy is minimal. In this representation of the law the force pushes the system towards a point of minimal potential energy. So the potential energy is defined by a graph that will have a downhill look.

The **negative sign** is important because force acts in the direction that **decreases** the potential energy.
In case we are just considering forces that are not conservatives we can express Newton's second law by it's more classical form $F = ma$
