Imagine that you have a rope that is attached at the end of the room you are currently in. You decide to make a constant motion on the rope such that it creates a constant wave as shown:

If they ask us where the wave is located we recognize that is a trivial question. Of course the wave is everywhere. but on the other end if they ask us what is wavelength $\lambda$ we can easily respond to that question.

Now we take another approach with our rope. We decide to give it a single impulse, creating this type of effect:

With that type of wave we can easily represent approximately it's position, but on the contrary is quite difficult to determinate $\lambda$ .
This type of uncertainty principle for waves remains true also for the quantum world, due to the wave-particle duality.

Now the wavelength of $\psi$ is related to the momentum of the particle by the [[DOUBLE SLIT EXPERIMENT AND DE BROGLIE WAVELENGTH|de Broglie formula]]
$$p = \frac{h}{\lambda}$$
Then based on the observations made on the quantum systems we can express the famous *Heisenberg uncertainty principle* which is the following:
$$\Delta x \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}$$
This principle suggests another important important fact, that the operators $\hat{x}$ and $\hat{p}$ do not commute and follow this type of equation:
$$[\hat{x}, \hat{p}] = \hat{x}\hat{p} - \hat{p}\hat{x} = i\hbar
$$
This is a phenomenal property that proves us that physical observable are no more numbers because does not exist such number (real or complex) that satisfies that property. If you change the order of multiplication of two numbers the result will still be the same.
