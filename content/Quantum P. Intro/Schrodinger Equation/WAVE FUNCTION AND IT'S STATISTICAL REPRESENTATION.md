But at the end of the day what the hell is a *wave function*?. In practice a wave function does describe a particle, but as the name suggest, is spread out in space. So do understand what is a wave function we have to abandon classical concepts and start to think probabilistic.

## Probabilistic interpretation of a wave function
The wave function by itself does not wave a particular meaning, but if we take it's absolute value and we square that we obtain an always positive function that could represent a probability distribution of position(or another physical observable).

But one of the core concept of quantum mechanics is that after the physical observable is measured, it *collapses* to a certain value guided by it's probability distribution

## Normalization
If we consider that the wave function could be interpreted statistically as a probability distribution, then we have also assume that it must follow the following principle.

Without this concept the statistical interpretation would be no-sense. But as we consider the linearity of the Schrodinger we also must consider that if $\psi(x,t)$ is a solution of the equation, also $A\psi(x,t)$ is a solution of the equation and if $\psi(x,t)$ follow the previous principle, $A\psi(x,t)$ could not. So we must introduce the *normalization principle* for the wave function.
But there are cases where the domain of the wave function is infinite or on the other end where $\psi = 0$. In such cases there is no multiplicative factor A that we can apply to satisfy the normalization principle. That demonstrate that exists wave functions that are solution of the Schrodinger equation but must not be accepted because they do not posses a physical meaning

But following this line of though there is another problem that arises. If we normalize $\psi$ at time t= 0, how could we know that it will stay normalized for the following instants of time?
Fortunately the wave function has the remarkable property that if you normalize it one time *it will stay normalize*. Without that property all quantum mechanics would fall under it's weight.
