The Schrodinger equation has the same functions in quantum mechanics as Newton's second law has for classical mechanics. Of course there are many difference between the two but the principal is that newton's law aims to give the position of the particle given the initial position and velocity.
$$m \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = -\frac{\partial V}{\partial x}$$
In this form, the force F is expressed as the negative gradient of the potential energy $V(x)$.

But in the Schrodinger equation we are interested in finding the wave function $\psi(x,t)$ instead of the position of the particle in time.
$$i \hbar \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} = - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2 \Psi}{\partial x^2} + V \Psi
$$
Given the initial conditions $\psi(x_0, t)$ the Schrodinger equation (as Newton's second law) gives the [[WAVE FUNCTION AND IT'S STATISTICAL REPRESENTATION|wave function]] for every future instant in time.
