The **Czochralski process for Gallium Arsenide (GaAs)** differs from the silicon growth process due to the unique physical properties of GaAs, particularly the volatility of arsenic. A modified version of the Czochralski process, called the **Liquid Encapsulated Czochralski (LEC)** method, is used to address the specific challenges in growing GaAs crystals. This modification is necessary because of arsenic’s low boiling point and its tendency to evaporate at high temperatures.

### Process Overview

In the LEC method, both gallium (Ga) and arsenic (As) are placed in a **pyrolytic boron nitride (BN)**crucible, which does not react with GaAs during the process. The key challenge in growing GaAs is preventing the evaporation of arsenic, which is addressed through two main approaches:

1. **High-Pressure Arsenic Atmosphere**:
    
    - The reactor chamber is pressurized with arsenic vapor to suppress arsenic evaporation. Arsenic is a highly volatile element, and at the temperatures required to melt gallium arsenide (~1238°C), arsenic would rapidly evaporate if not contained. The high-pressure arsenic environment maintains the stoichiometric balance of GaAs during the growth process.
2. **Boron Oxide (B₂O₃) Encapsulation**:
    
    - In addition to the arsenic vapor pressure, a layer of **molten boron oxide (B₂O₃)** is applied on top of the GaAs melt. This layer acts as a liquid encapsulant, further preventing the loss of arsenic by forming a seal over the melt. B₂O₃ has a melting point of around 500°C, and it remains molten during the entire process, providing a protective barrier that prevents the evaporation of arsenic while allowing the crystal to grow.
    - The use of B₂O₃ is essential because it does not react with GaAs, making it an ideal material to encapsulate the melt without contaminating the crystal or altering its composition​.

### Crystal Growth Process

Once the gallium arsenide mixture is melted and encapsulated by B₂O₃, a small **seed crystal** of GaAs is dipped into the molten GaAs. The seed crystal has a well-defined crystallographic orientation, which ensures that the entire ingot adopts the same orientation during the pulling process. The seed crystal is slowly pulled upward while rotating. As the seed is pulled from the melt, the GaAs solidifies onto the seed, growing a single-crystal ingot.

During the pulling process, careful control of the pulling speed, temperature, and rotation is crucial to avoid the formation of defects such as dislocations or non-uniform crystal growth. Due to the differing vapor pressures of gallium and arsenic, controlling these parameters is more complex than in silicon crystal growth, where both elements have more stable physical properties.

### Post-Growth Steps

After the GaAs crystal is grown to the desired size, the crystal is slowly cooled, and the encapsulating B₂O₃ layer is removed. The resulting ingot is then inspected for defects, such as dislocations or variations in resistivity, which can occur due to the segregation of dopants or imperfections in the crystal structure. The crystal is then cut into wafers, which are used in the production of high-frequency electronics, optoelectronic devices like LEDs, and other semiconductor applications.
