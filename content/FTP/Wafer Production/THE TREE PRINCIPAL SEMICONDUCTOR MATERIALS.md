## Silicon
-  **Description**: Silicon is the most widely used [[SEMICONDUCTORS |semiconductor material]] used in electronics. It is relative cheap, widely available and has great conductive properties.
- **Use**: - Primary material for the production of integrated circuits (ICs) and microelectronics. Used in photovoltaic cells for solar energy conversion. It's also the  basis for most semiconductor devices due to its stable [[DIFFERENCES IN CRYSTALLINE STRUCTURES|crystalline structure]] and the ability to control its electrical properties through [[DOPING CHEMICAL INTERPRETATION|doping]].

## III-V Elements(Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) and Indium Phosphide (InP))
- **Description**: Both GaAs and InP are **III-V compound semiconductors**, composed of elements from group III (Gallium or Indium) and group V (Arsenic or Phosphorus). These materials offer higher electron mobility than silicon, making them ideal for high-speed, high-frequency, and optoelectronic applications. GaAs is favored for certain radio frequency and microwave applications, while InP is particularly well-suited for photonics and fiber-optic communication systems.
- **Use(Gallium Arsenide)**: High-frequency and microwave applications (e.g., satellite communication, radar).
- **Use(Indium Phosphide)**: Mainly [[OPTOELECTRONICS|optoelectronics]] applications

## Silicon Carbide(SiC)
- **Description**:SiC is a compound of silicon and carbon. It has exceptional thermal conductivity, a high breakdown electric field, and can function at high temperatures, making it suitable for extreme environments.
- **Use**: Power electronics requiring high efficiency and stability at high temperatures (e.g., electric vehicles, power grids) and high-voltage devices in aerospace and military applications​.
