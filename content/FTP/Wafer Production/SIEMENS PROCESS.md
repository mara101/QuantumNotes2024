The Siemens process it's the process that allow us to separate the silicon from the molecules of chlore atoms and the hydrogen atom and to obtain Electronig Grade Silicon (EGS).
It consists in taking the trichlorosilane gas, which has already been purified through fractional distillation and then make it reacted with hydrogen gas in a reactor at high temperatures (around 1100°C). The reaction is the following:
						 *HSiCl3​+H2​→Si(solid)+3HCl(gas)*
					
This reaction leads to the deposition of silicon onto heated silicon rods, which act as seeds for crystal growth. The reactor contains these silicon seed rods, which are placed in a cold chamber. The chamber is heated, and the trichlorosilane and hydrogen gas mixture is introduced. As the gas mixture decomposes, the resulting silicon atoms deposit onto the seed rods in a highly controlled manner, growing into high-purity polycrystalline silicon.
This deposition process typically takes several days, allowing the silicon layer to build up gradually. The final product is extremely pure polycrystalline silicon, with impurity levels of less than 1 part per billion (1 impurity per 10⁹ silicon atoms). 
This high-purity silicon is then used as the raw material for the production of monocrystalline silicon via the [[CZOCHRALSKI PROCESS|Czochralski]] or Float-Zone processes, which are vital for producing silicon wafers used in integrated circuits and other electronic devices.
