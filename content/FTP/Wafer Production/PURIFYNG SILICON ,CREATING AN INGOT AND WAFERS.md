The main problem in the wafer creation is that we need to create a very pure silicon(or another [[SEMICONDUCTORS|semiconductor]]) ingot, which we can cut and create the various wafer substrates.
The Silicon must encounter various processes and transformation to eliminate the impurities, because the chip creation requires that the substrate electrical properties are as physically controllable as possible. If we don't have extremely pure silicon (usually with impurity levels of less than 1 part per billion), we can't control it's physical properties with sufficient precision. 
On the other and we must also want to crystallize the solid silicon in a [[DIFFERENCES IN CRYSTALLINE STRUCTURES|monocrystalline structure]] because polycrystalline silicon possesses [[DIFFERENCES IN CRYSTALLINE STRUCTURES|grain boundaries]](the interruption of a local monocrystalline section and the beginning of another one with another orientation) that change the local conductive properties of the material and can act as a potential energy barrier or traps for electrons.

Those are the various processes that transforms quartz based sand into a mostly pure crystalline silicon ingot and then getting wafers:
