Once we obtain our trichlorosiline compound (HSiCl3) in a liquid form we need to provide a method to separate our desired liquid compounds from other contaminants. This is method is the fractional distillation, which is the same process used also for the separation  of hydrocarbons.
This methods emphasize the difference in boiling temperatures of different compounds in stages. So the liquid mixture is heated in stages and at every stages the vapor of the compound is recollected and liquefied again. In this way we can easily separate the HSiCl3 (at boiling temperature of 35 C) from the other compounds presents in the mixture.

The following image represents the fractional distillation for crude oil (but the concept is the same).
