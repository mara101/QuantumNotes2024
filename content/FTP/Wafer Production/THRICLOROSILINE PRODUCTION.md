The purpose of this process is to transform the [[SILICON REFINING|metallurgical grade silicon]] into a form that can be easily managed for further purification, in our case we want to put the silicon in a liquid form(at room temperature) with the help of **hydrochloric acid (HCl)**.

- **Starting Material**: Metallurgical Grade Silicon (MGS) produced in the silicon refining process, which is approximately 98% pure, but contains metal impurities that need to be removed for electronic applications.
    
- **Process Overview**:
    
    - **Chemical Reaction**: MGS is reacted with **hydrochloric acid (HCl)** gas at a temperature of approximately 325°C to form **trichlorosilane (HSiCl₃)**, a key intermediate compound.
        - **Reaction**:Si(solid)+3HCl(gas)→HSiCl3(gas)+H2(gas)Si(solid)+3HCl(gas)→HSiCl3​(gas)+H2​(gas)
    - **Reaction Conditions**: This is an exothermic reaction (releases heat), so the temperature must be controlled to stay around 325°C to minimize byproduct formation and ensure the correct production of trichlorosilane.
- **Trichlorosilane (HSiCl₃)**:
    
    - **State**: Trichlorosilane is a **liquid** at room temperature, with a boiling point of 32°C.
    - **Purpose of Production**: Trichlorosilane is an intermediate product that can be purified more easily than solid silicon, enabling the removal of metallic impurities present in MGS.
- **Impurities**:
    
    - During the production of trichlorosilane, some residual impurities such as **boron (B)** and **phosphorus (P)** may remain. These impurities must be removed in subsequent steps.
