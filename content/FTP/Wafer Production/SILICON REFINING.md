This techniques is used to obtain metallurgical grade solid silicon, which has a purity of about *98%*. The quartz based sand is inserted in a furnace and heated at 2000 degrees Celsius for *8 days*.
The principal reactions is the following: *SiO2​+2C→Si(solid)+2CO(gas)*
- **Impurities in MGS**: Contains small amounts of metals such as:
    
    - **Iron (Fe)**: 0.8%
    - **Aluminum (Al)**: 0.3%
    - **Chromium (Cr)**: 0.04%
    - **Titanium (Ti)**: 0.03%
    - **Manganese (Mn)** and **Vanadium (V)**: 0.02%
