A **semiconductor material** is a type of substance that has electrical conductivity between that of a conductor (like copper) and an insulator (like glass). This means it can conduct electricity under certain conditions, but not as well as a full conductor. Semiconductors are the foundation of modern electronics because they allow for precise control of electrical current, which is essential for building devices like transistors, diodes, and integrated circuits (ICs).
### Key Properties:

1. **Intermediate Conductivity**: Semiconductor materials have a conductivity level between insulators and conductors. This conductivity can be controlled through various means, such as temperature changes, electrical fields, or by adding impurities (a process called **doping**).
    
2. **Doping**: By introducing small amounts of impurities ([[DOPING CHEMICAL INTERPRETATION|dopants]]) into the material, the electrical properties of semiconductors can be finely tuned. 
3. **Band Gap**: Semiconductors have a distinct **band gap**, the energy difference between the valence band (where electrons are bound to atoms) and the conduction band (where electrons can move freely). This gap is small enough that external energy (like heat or light) can move electrons from the valence to the conduction band, enabling electrical conduction.
