Cleanroom technology plays a crucial role in the semiconductor and nanotechnology industries, where controlling contamination is essential for ensuring product quality, performance, and safety. Cleanrooms are controlled environments where the concentration of airborne particles is minimized and various parameters such as temperature, humidity, and pressure are tightly regulated.
### Contamination Induced Problems in Cleanroom Environments

Contamination within cleanrooms can cause several significant issues that impact the functionality, reliability, and performance of devices, especially in industries like semiconductor fabrication, where precision is essential. These contamination-induced problems arise due to particles, mobile ions, and unintentional films, leading to defects that can disrupt the manufacturing process and cause device failures.

-  **Particles in the Environment**

	Particles are one of the primary sources of contamination in cleanrooms. These are undesired objects with sizes ranging from about 0.06 µm to a few microns, depending on their source. The composition of these particles varies, including dust, skin flakes, and residues from processes or materials. Particles can adhere to surfaces via various forces, such as:
	
	- **Van der Waals forces**: Particles can attach to surfaces due to weak intermolecular forces.
	- **Condensation of vapor**: Particles can adhere to surfaces when vapor condenses, forming a bond between the particle and the surface.
	- **Chemical bonding**: Some particles chemically react with the surface, forming strong bonds.

	These particles can lead to significant problems, including jamming movable microstructures, which is especially problematic in devices with delicate components, such as microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). In addition, particles can interfere with processes like photolithography, where they can cause defects, such as shadowing effects, leading to either:
	
	- **Short circuits (Defect – Short)**: Particles may bridge gaps between circuit elements, causing unintentional electrical connections.
	- **Open circuits (Defect – Open)**: Particles may block or shadow specific areas during processing, preventing electrical connections from forming properly.

- **Mobile Ions in Oxides**

	Another contamination-induced problem arises from mobile ions, such as sodium (Na+), present in oxides. These ions can migrate within the oxide layers of semiconductor devices, especially under electric fields. This migration alters the electric fields and voltages at the interface between the semiconductor and the dielectric, potentially leading to changes in the device’s electrical properties. This can degrade the performance or cause the failure of the device over time, particularly in field-effect transistors (FETs), where precise control of the electric field is crucial.

- **Unintentional Films Between Layers**

	During the fabrication of multilayer devices, contamination can result in the deposition of unintentional films between layers. These films can arise from various sources, including residual chemicals, vapors, or particulate matter. The presence of unintentional films leads to several critical issues:
	
	- **Open Circuits or Short Circuits**: Unintentional films can disrupt the electrical connectivity between layers. If the film is insulating, it may prevent the necessary electrical connection, causing open circuits. Conversely, if the film is conductive, it may create undesired pathways between layers, leading to short circuits.
	- **Impeded Adhesion Between Films**: The presence of these films can also interfere with the adhesion between different layers, especially when bonding thin films during device fabrication. Poor adhesion can result in delamination or the formation of voids, compromising the structural integrity of the device.

### Sources of Contamination

Contaminants in cleanrooms can originate from multiple sources:

1. **Humans**: Humans are the largest source of contamination in cleanrooms. Skin constantly sheds particles, hair falls out, and oils and dirt from the skin and clothing are introduced into the cleanroom environment. Moreover, the widespread use of personal care products, such as makeup, hair gel, and perfumes, exacerbates contamination. This is why cleanroom personnel must follow strict protocols and wear special garments, including coveralls, gloves, masks, and hairnets, to minimize the release of particles​.
    
2. **Machines**: Equipment used in cleanroom environments can also be a significant source of contamination. Over time, machines experience wear and tear, leading to the release of particles from components like rubber seals, lubricants, and plastic parts. Automated wafer handling systems can cause abrasion, releasing particles into the air. Proper maintenance and regular cleaning of machinery are essential to minimize contamination from these sources​.
    
3. **Materials**: The chemicals, gases, and liquids used in cleanrooms must be free of particulates and contaminants. Materials such as water, solvents, and gases can introduce impurities if they are not properly filtered and purified before use. For example, deionized water used in wafer cleaning must undergo several filtration processes to ensure that no particles or organic contaminants remain​.
    
4. **Processes**: Many processes in cleanroom environments, such as etching, deposition, and chemical treatments, generate particles or chemical residues that can lead to contamination. These particles may adhere to surfaces due to forces such as van der Waals attraction, chemical bonding, or condensation. In photolithography, for instance, even a tiny particle can cause a shadowing defect, leading to open circuits or short circuits in the final product​​.
