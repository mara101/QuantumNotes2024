[[CLEANROOM|Cleanrooms]] are classified based on the concentration of airborne particles within a defined space, which directly impacts the cleanliness of the environment. Cleanroom classifications specify the maximum allowable concentration of particles of a certain size per unit volume of air. The classification system has evolved over time to provide more stringent and precise control over particle contamination, and cleanroom designs have been adapted to meet the demands of these standards.
### Early Cleanroom Standards: Federal Standard 209

The concept of cleanroom classification was formalized in 1966 with the introduction of the **Federal Standard 209**. This standard, developed in the United States, defined cleanrooms by their allowable particle concentration, specifically focusing on the number of particles larger than 0.5 microns per cubic foot of air. Cleanrooms were categorized into various classes, such as Class 100, Class 1,000, and Class 10,000. For instance, a Class 100 cleanroom is allowed no more than 100 particles greater than 0.5 microns per cubic foot of air​.

The classes defined by this standard were represented as a line on a graph, indicating the particle concentration in relation to particle size. The cleanroom belonged to a specific class if the number of particles of a given size fell below the defined threshold. 
Today even if this is not more valid as a standard we still use it to talk generally about a cleanroom but every modern cleanroom is categorized in a more modern way.
### Modern Cleanroom Standards: ISO 14644

While Federal Standard 209 was widely used, modern cleanrooms are often classified according to the **ISO 14644** standard, which provides a more comprehensive and international approach to cleanroom classification. ISO 14644 defines cleanrooms based on the concentration of particles per cubic meter, rather than per cubic foot, offering a more precise and detailed system of classification that includes also restraints on: temperature, pressure, humidity and clothing of the personnel. This standard is divided into classes, ranging from ISO Class 1 to ISO Class 9, with ISO Class 1 being the most stringent and ISO Class 9 being the least strict.

- **ISO Class 1 Cleanrooms**: These environments allow fewer than 10 particles per cubic meter that are 0.1 microns or larger.
- **ISO Class 5 Cleanrooms**: Similar to the Federal Standard 209 Class 100, an ISO Class 5 cleanroom allows up to 100,000 particles per cubic meter that are 0.1 microns or larger.
- **ISO Class 9 Cleanrooms**: These cleanrooms are similar to typical office environments and allow up to 35 million particles per cubic meter that are 0.5 microns or larger​​.
### Cleanroom Design to Meet Classification Requirements

The design of cleanrooms is heavily influenced by their classification, as the higher the cleanliness class, the more complex and costly the cleanroom becomes to build and operate. For instance, a Class 100 cleanroom requires much more stringent control over airborne particles than a Class 10,000 cleanroom. To achieve the necessary cleanliness, cleanrooms are designed with features such as **laminar airflow**, which helps to reduce particle contamination by ensuring that air moves in a straight, unidirectional flow. This minimizes turbulence, which could otherwise cause particles to be stirred up and distributed throughout the room​.

Usually the cleanroom have three different filtration stages to recirculate the air in the cleanroom and to block contaminants. 

- **Pre Filter Stage**: This is the initial filtration stage where air entering the raised floor which job is to create a space where air can flow and where particles can pass trough the holes of the floor, then is passed through pre filters. The purpose of pre filters is to remove larger particles and debris from the incoming air, thus extending the life of the more sensitive filters in later stages. Pre filters are typically less expensive and easy to replace. They act as the first line of defense, capturing particles that would otherwise burden the High-Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) or Ultra-Low Penetration Air (ULPA) filters​.
    
- **HEPA (High-Efficiency Particulate Air) or ULPA (Ultra-Low Penetration Air) Filters**: The second stage of filtration is more critical. HEPA filters are commonly used in most cleanrooms and are capable of removing 99.97% of airborne particles as small as 0.3 microns. In cleanrooms with stricter standards, ULPA filters are used. These filters provide an even higher level of filtration, capturing 99.999% of particles down to 0.12 microns. 
    
- **Final Filter Stage**: In some cleanroom setups, a final stage of filtration is added for environments requiring the strictest levels of cleanliness. This may involve additional HEPA or ULPA filtration near specific workstations or zones within the cleanroom, where ultra-clean conditions are necessary. This stage ensures that any residual contaminants are removed before air reaches critical production areas​.

In addition to airflow and filtration systems, the **temperature and humidity** inside the cleanroom must also be carefully regulated to meet classification standards. Temperature is typically maintained between 20°C and 22°C, while humidity is controlled at around 50% relative humidity (RH). This prevents issues such as condensation, which can introduce additional particles, and minimizes the risk of electrostatic discharge (ESD), which can damage sensitive components​.

### Cleanroom Cost: The Impact of Increasing Classification

One of the most significant factors to consider in cleanroom design is the cost of building and maintaining a cleanroom, which increases exponentially with stricter cleanliness classifications. The cost of constructing a cleanroom rises as the required level of cleanliness increases because more sophisticated design features, filtration systems, and environmental controls are needed to maintain the higher standards.
For instance, a **Class 100 cleanroom** (ISO Class 5) is far more expensive to build and operate than a **Class 10,000 cleanroom** (ISO Class 7). This is because a Class 100 cleanroom requires more advanced HEPA or ULPA filtration systems, stricter airflow control (often through laminar flow systems), and more frequent air exchanges to maintain the required particle concentration. Additionally, the personnel working in higher-class cleanrooms must wear more protective clothing and follow stricter protocols, which further adds to the operational cost​.

### Pressure Control in Cleanrooms

Maintaining proper **pressure differentials** is another essential aspect of cleanroom design that directly impacts classification and cost. Cleanrooms are generally kept at **positive pressure** relative to their surroundings to prevent contaminated air from entering the controlled environment. This positive pressure ensures that when doors or other access points are opened, clean air flows out of the room rather than allowing unfiltered air to flow in. The required pressure difference increases with the cleanliness class of the cleanroom. For example:

- Class 100, Class 1,000, and Class 10,000 cleanrooms typically maintain a pressure differential of around 25 Pa (pascals) between the cleanroom and adjacent areas.
- For Class 1 or Class 10 cleanrooms, the pressure differential may be as high as 75-100 Pa, ensuring that even the smallest potential contaminants are kept out​.

This pressure control adds to the overall complexity and cost of designing and operating higher-class cleanrooms, as more sophisticated air handling systems are required to maintain the necessary pressure differentials.

### Cleanroom Classification and Particle Measurement

The classification of cleanrooms is based on the measurement of particles in the air, typically using instruments that detect and count particles by **optical scattering of a laser beam**. This method is preferred over traditional filtering and counting techniques, which are often too slow for real-time monitoring. By shining a laser beam through the air in the cleanroom, the particles scatter the light, which is detected by sensors and counted. This process allows for continuous monitoring of the cleanroom’s cleanliness level, ensuring that it remains within the specified classification limits​.
