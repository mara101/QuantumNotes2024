Lithography, derived from the Greek words "lithos" meaning stone and "graphein" meaning to write, is a critical technique used in micro- and nanofabrication processes. It plays a fundamental role in the manufacturing of semiconductor devices, including integrated circuits (ICs) and other microelectronic components. Lithography enables the transfer of intricate circuit patterns onto a substrate, typically a silicon wafer, by utilizing a light-sensitive polymer called [[PHOTORESIST AND EXPOSURE SOURCES|photoresist]]. This process is essential for defining the micro-scale patterns required in modern electronic devices.

### Photolithography and Masks
Photolithography is the process in lithography that is used for batch fabrication of devices on the Silicon wafers. This process is analogous to the printing press for paper. In photolithography we want to impress the hole pattern of the circuit in the substrate. To do so we need a reference for the pattern we want to print, this type of reference is called **mask**

A mask is a device which contains the pattern desired for photolithography. A lithographic mask typically consists of a flat, transparent substrate, often made of quartz or high-purity silicon dioxide (SiO₂), which is coated with a thin, opaque layer of material—usually chromium (Cr). This opaque layer blocks light from passing through specific areas of the mask. Usually for the production of electronic devices many masks with different layouts are needed, even a set of around 50 masks for a complex device.

Masks are usually more complex to fabricate in respect to the devices. The production of a lithographic mask is a highly specialized and precise process, involving several steps to ensure the creation of patterns with nanometer-scale accuracy. The mask-making process is crucial because any defects or misalignments in the mask can lead to faulty semiconductor devices. Mask contains also alignment marks that allows a correct orientation and position in photolithography.
