Volume defects are disruptions that occur within the bulk of a crystalline material and can affect a significant region of the crystal. Based on the course slides you provided, these defects include:

1. **Impurities**:
    
    - Impurities introduced into a crystal can exceed the solid solubility limit of the host material, especially when temperatures change. If the crystal is cooled after being doped at high temperatures, the excess impurities, which can no longer be dissolved in the host crystal, tend to precipitate and form regions of different compositions. This leads to localized changes in volume, known as **volume dislocations** .
2. **Micropipes**:
    
    - Micropipes are cylindrical hollow defects that often form in materials like silicon carbide (SiC). They arise due to improper crystal growth processes, leading to significant mechanical and electrical property degradation. These defects can extend through the material, creating channels that disrupt the crystal's uniformity .
3. **Comets**:
    
    - Comets are another type of volume defect found in SiC. These are elongated defects that resemble a comet shape and are typically formed due to variations in the crystal growth environment, particularly temperature gradients. They are visible under microscopy and also affect the mechanical integrity of the material.
