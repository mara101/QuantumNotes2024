The three main types of crystalline structures commonly discussed are **monocrystalline**, **polycrystalline**, and **amorphous**. Each has distinct structural characteristics, which affect their applications, particularly in semiconductor technologies:

1. **Monocrystalline structure**: This type refers to a material where the crystal is continuous and unbroken throughout the entire sample, with no grain boundaries. All atoms are arranged in a single, uniform crystal structure. This high level of order allows for superior electronic properties, as electrons can move freely without being scattered by grain boundaries. Monocrystalline materials, such as single-crystal silicon, are often used in high-performance electronic devices and photovoltaic applications, due to their excellent charge carrier mobility.
    
2. **Polycrystalline structure**: In this case, the material is made up of many small crystals or grains, each with a different orientation. While the material is crystalline, the grains are separated by grain boundaries, where the crystal structure is disrupted. Polycrystalline materials, such as polysilicon, are easier and cheaper to manufacture than monocrystalline materials but have lower electrical efficiency because grain boundaries hinder electron movement. They are commonly used in applications like solar cells and MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems).
    
3. **Amorphous structure**: Amorphous materials lack a long-range periodic atomic arrangement altogether. This means that atoms are randomly arranged, much like a liquid or glass. Amorphous silicon, for instance, is cheaper to produce than crystalline forms and can be deposited on a variety of substrates. However, its disordered structure results in poorer electronic properties, making it less suitable for high-performance electronics, though it is widely used in thin-film transistors and flexible electronics due to its manufacturability.

## The 14 Possible Lattice Structures
There are 14 possible Lattice (crystalline) structure and are noted in the following immage.

But only one type of structure will be important to us. This type of lattice structure is the cubic structure. There are three possible cubic structures:
- *Simple Cubic* which is a structure that have the atoms placed only at the vertices of the solid( 8 atoms). This structure in nature is only present in the Polonium lattice.

- *Body Centered Cubic* which add to the Simple Cubic Structure only an atom at the center of the cube. (9 atoms)

- *Face Centered Cube* which is a structure that has atoms in the vertices but also an atom per face of the cube (14 atoms).

The parameter that describe the lattice cubical structure is **the lattice parameter $a_0$ = length of a cube side**

## Crystalline Defects
Not all crystals are perfect and they always presents imperfections in their structures. Those imperfections can be subdivided in three categories.

- **[[LINE DEFECTS|Line Defects]]**
- [[SURFACE DEFECTS|Surface Defects]]

## Miller Indices
Miller indices are a way in crystallography to describe the lattice orientation and orientation  plane. Those properties influence greatly the physical properties of the material.

#### **Procedure for Determining Miller Indices**:

To define the orientation of a plane in a crystal lattice, the following steps are used:

- **Identify the intercepts**: Determine where the plane intersects the three crystallographic axes (x, y, z) in terms of lattice constants (unit cell dimensions).
- **Take reciprocals**: Take the reciprocals of these intercepts (if the intercept is at infinity, the reciprocal is zero).
- **Reduce to smallest integers**: Reduce these reciprocals to the smallest set of integers that still retain the same ratios.

For example, if a plane intercepts the x-axis at 1, the y-axis at infinity, and the z-axis at infinity, the Miller indices for that plane would be:

- Intercepts: (1, ∞, ∞)
- Reciprocals: (1, 0, 0)
- Miller Index: (100)![[Screenshot_20240928_154140.png]]

But the most important orientation are basically three (the one that are used in most applications):
- **(100)**: A plane parallel to the y and z axes, intersecting the x-axis at one lattice unit.
- **(110)**: A plane intersecting both the x and y axes but parallel to the z-axis.
- **(111)**: A plane that intersects all three axes.
