#### Silicon
Silicon follow the *Diamond Cubic Structure* which is a special type of structure in which the atoms have all the same distance from each others(1/4 of the length of the diagonal of the cube). Note that the Diamond Structure does not reference a diamond in his shape, but was named as so because it was first observed in diamonds. This structure contains 18 atoms in total (8 for the vertices, 6 in the faces, 4 internal atoms).

#### III-V Compounds
This type of compounds follow a *Zincoblende* type lattice structure. This type of structure is identical to the diamond one but with a key difference. [[SEMICONDUCTORS|III-V]] compounds are composed of two elements, so the atoms in the diamond structures are alternated between group III atoms and group V atoms.
