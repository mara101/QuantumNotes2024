Point defects are a type of defects where a single atom is misplaced. Those type of defects arises from either a too fast deposition or a low substrate temperature. Those defects are the following. Those types of defects could be also be used to create particular properties wanted from the manufacturer
- **Vacancy defects** when an atom is missing in the proper position. In case of III-V elements this type of defects could be:
	- *Anionic* if an anion is missing from the structure, so an element from group V
	- *Cationic* if a cation is missing from the structure, so an element from group III
	This type of defect create an inner strain from the outside atoms that pushes the boundaries atoms are pushed closer together.

- **Interstitial defects** are defects that arises when there is an extra atom that is placed where it should not be. This creates a type of strain contrary to the strain created by the vacancy defects, where the atoms are pushed further apart in that zone

- **Substitutional defects** arises when a foreign atoms occupy the place of a structure atom.

- **Antisite defects** arises only in III-V compounds and consists basically in the swapping of an atom from it's structural place
