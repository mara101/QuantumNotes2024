The only type of line dislocation we have studied is the *Edge dislocation* which is a type of defect that is caused usually by a quick temperature shift in the crystal that induce the shift of plane in the crystal, with the insertion of an extra plane. The line of the extra plane without bonds will be called *dislocation line*.
