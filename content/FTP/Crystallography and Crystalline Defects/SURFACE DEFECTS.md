There are two possible types of *surface defects*:
- **Grain Boundaries** which are a type of defects that describes a type of [[DIFFERENCES IN CRYSTALLINE STRUCTURES|polycristalline structure]]. Those boundaries separates the contiguous crystalline structures and they represent a problem because they are more reactive and if the boundaries area is too large it become impossible to do precise chemical etchings.

- **Gemination** refers to a specific type of crystalline defect where there is anÂ **abrupt variation in crystal orientation**. This occurs when two distinct crystal domains share some of their lattice points in a symmetrical manner, but the overall orientation of the crystal structure changes sharply at the boundary between these domains.
