Those security principles are essentials to guide the [[SECURITY IN THE LIFETIME OF A SYSTEM AND WINDOW OF EXPOSURE|implementation and maintenance]] of a system.
1. **Security by Design**:  Security is integrated from the very beginning, ensuring a strong foundation of protection throughout the system's lifecycle.
2. **Security in Depth**: A layered approach to security where multiple defense mechanisms are implemented, so if one layer fails, others are still in place to protect the system.
3. **Security by Default**: Systems should be configured with secure settings by default to reduce the risk of security breaches due to weak initial configurations.
4. **Least Privilege**: Ensuring that users and systems have only the minimum level of access needed to perform their tasks, limiting the potential damage from attacks or errors.
5. **Need-to-Know**: Access to sensitive information is restricted to only those who need it to perform their specific duties, preventing unnecessary data exposure​.

### The CIA Triad
The CIA triad represents the core objectives of cybersecurity, which are confidentiality, integrity, and availability. These three elements are essential for protecting information systems.

- **Confidentiality**: Protects sensitive information from being accessed by unauthorized users or systems, ensuring privacy.
- **Integrity**: Ensures that data remains accurate, complete, and unaltered by unauthorized parties.
- **Availability**: Ensures that systems and data are accessible and usable when needed, even in the face of attacks or failures​​.

### Abstract Security Properties / Services
These are high-level security functions or services that are implemented to safeguard systems and data across various scenarios.
1. **Authentication(Single or Mutual)**: Confirms the identity of users or systems before allowing access, ensuring that only legitimate entities interact with the system.
2. **Authorization (Access Control)**: Defines what an authenticated user or system is allowed to do, managing permissions and preventing unauthorized actions.
3. **Integrity**: Protects data from being altered or tampered with by unauthorized parties, ensuring that the information remains correct and reliable.
4. **Confidentiality (Privacy, Secrecy)**: Ensures that information is kept private and is only accessible to those authorized to see it, typically enforced through encryption.
5. **Non-Repudiation**: Provides proof of the authenticity and integrity of data or communications, preventing parties from denying their involvement in a transaction.
6. **Availability**: Focuses on ensuring that systems and data are accessible when needed, minimizing downtime and service interruptions.
7. **Traceability / Accountability**: Tracks user actions within a system, ensuring that activities can be traced back to individuals for auditing or forensic purposes​​.
