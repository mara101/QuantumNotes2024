The first axiom of engineering and the KISS rule(Keep it Simple, stupid) basically says the same things. 
==The more complex a system is, the more difficult its correctness verification will be (implementation, management, operation)==
A great example that demonstrate that core concept is the fact that the number of bugs grows quadratically with the numbers of lines in the code. (O(n^2) where n is the number of lines)
The KISS rule as the first axiom of engineering advocate for the simplest implementation possible of the system, so it can be more secure.
==The less the complex the system, the more secure and easy to maintain it could be.==
