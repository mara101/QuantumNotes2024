In this section, we delve into the behavior of **free carriers** in semiconductors under **non-equilibrium conditions**, focusing on how they contribute to the **current density**. When semiconductors are not in thermal equilibrium, two main types of current arise: one due to the physical movement of free carriers and the other from the dielectric displacement caused by a time-varying electric field.
### Free Carrier Movement

The first type of current is associated with the **motion of free carriers**, such as electrons and holes, in the conduction and valence bands, respectively. These carriers generate a **current density** based on their flux. The particle flux $\Phi$, which represents the number of carriers crossing a unit area per unit time, is a crucial factor here. The resulting current density is the product of the electrical charge carried by each particle and the flux. This relationship is expressed mathematically as:

$J_n = -q \Phi_n$ for electrons, and $J_p = +q \Phi_p$ for holes.

Here, $J_n$ and $J_p$ represent the current densities for electrons and holes, respectively, while $q$ denotes the elementary charge. This current arises when the motion of carriers is organized, in contrast to their random thermal motion seen in equilibrium conditions. For free carriers to contribute to a net current, their velocity must allow for this **ordered motion**.
### Dielectric Displacement Current
The second contribution to current density comes from **dielectric displacement**, which is related to a **time-varying electric field**. The displacement current density $J_{\text{disp}}$ is defined by the time derivative of the dielectric displacement vector $D$, where $D = \epsilon E$, with $\epsilon$ being the dielectric constant and $E$ the electric field:

$J_{\text{disp}} = \frac{\partial D}{\partial t}$.

This displacement current plays a significant role when the electric field is not static but changing over time.
### Drift and Diffusion Currents in Semiconductors

In semiconductors, free carriers can move due to both **drift** and **diffusion** mechanisms. Drift current occurs when an electric field is applied, driving electrons from regions of lower electrostatic potential to higher potential. This behavior is typical of metals, where conduction electrons always fill the available states up to the Fermi level, making diffusion negligible.

However, semiconductors exhibit a more complex behavior. Besides drift current, they also support **diffusion current**, which arises when there is a **gradient in carrier concentration**. In semiconductors, electrons do not fill all the available states in the conduction band, leaving room for the creation of **carrier gradients**. These gradients can be induced intentionally by **non-uniform doping**, making diffusion a critical process in semiconductor devices.

This ability of semiconductors to support both drift and diffusion currents contrasts sharply with metals, where diffusion is almost non-existent. In metals, the electron distribution is highly uniform, and any significant carrier gradient is difficult to achieve. In semiconductors, on the other hand, carrier non-uniformity is easily induced, which is one of the primary reasons they have become essential in modern electronics. The role of diffusion is so important that it gives semiconductors a level of **flexibility and superiority** over ordinary conductors in electronic applications.

### Key Differences Between Metals and Semiconductors

In summary, while metals rely primarily on drift current under the influence of an electric field, semiconductors benefit from an additional current mechanism—diffusion—arising from carrier concentration gradients. This dual contribution to current flow is what makes semiconductors so versatile in electronic devices, offering capabilities far beyond what metals can achieve.
