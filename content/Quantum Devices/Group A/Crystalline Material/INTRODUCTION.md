The mast majorities of electronic devices base their properties upon the materials of which they are composed. The most important factors of that material are his *electric conductivity* and *electrical resistivity*. 
The electrical conductivity is expressed as $\sigma$ (S/cm, Siemens per centimeter) which quantifies the electric capacity of a material to conduct electricity. On the other end electrical resistivity is the reciprocal of the conductivity, so $\rho$ = $\frac{1}{\sigma}$ ($\ohm cm$ , Ohm per centimeter) and expresses how strongly a material opposes to the flow of electricity.

And then if we have an Electric field $E$ we can express the *current density* as $J_{cond} = E\sigma$ $A/cm^{2}$ 

Using electrical conductivity $\sigma$ as a parameter we can express categorize the various types of materials based on their electrical properties.
### Conductors
Conductors are elements that applies the minimal resistance to the flowing of electricity. An ideal conductor must follow this relation:
$$ \rho = 0$$
### Insulators or Dielectrics
Those types of material are insulators because they strongly oppose the flowing of current. An ideal insulator must follow this property:
$$\sigma = 0$$
Note that if a time varying Electric field is present $E(t)$ then we have a type of current flowing in the material that is called *displacement current density* which is a type of current that arises in every material due to the variation of the electric Field in time so the displacement current density is defined as such:

### Semiconductors
Semiconductors are elements that stays in between of being a conductor and an insulator. 
There is not a definitive way to define semiconductors, they are somewhat in a blurred line. Usually bellow the value of conductivity of $10^{-8} S/cm$ we refer to the material as an insulator, above $10^{3} S/cm$ we refer to it as a conductor. Those are some types of semiconductors:
