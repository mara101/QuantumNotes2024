### Interpretation of Two-Dimensional Structure of Silicon

We have already seen in the [[BAND THEORY FOR CRYSTALLINE MATERIALS|band theory for crystalline material]] that atoms of silicon are bonded together by strong double covalent bonds:

Now the immage above is the case for T=0K. In a real case we have holes in the valence band that translates in a *missing covalent bond*. ![[Screenshot_20241005_115841.png]]

### Semiconductor Doping
Semiconductor doping is a practice that insert a 'Foreign' atom in the crystalline structure. There are two possible types of doping:
- **n-doped semiconductors** where atoms of Silicon are substituted by group V(five valence electron) elements such as As. ![[Screenshot_20241005_172406.png|500]]
  In this type of doping the extra electron does not bond with the Silicon atom and creates a new energy state $E_d$. If the gap between $E_c$ and $E_d$ is small enough then the electron is promoted to the conduction band and therefore [[BAND THEORY FOR CRYSTALLINE MATERIALS|increases n]]. So this type of doping is called also as *donor type doping*.

- **p-type** doping is a type of doping where the atom of Silicon is substituted with a group III (3 valence electrons) such as B.![[Screenshot_20241005_174712.png]]
  This type of of doping creates a covalent bond vacancy. This type of bond vacancy that tries to be fulfilled by his neighbors. So a covalent bond nearby will break to complete the bonds with the boron atom.

  That happens because boron will create a new energy level $E_a$ that if sufficiently near $E_v$ will allow the donation of an electron of silicon nearby as just mentioned. This type of procedure will create an [[BAND THEORY FOR CRYSTALLINE MATERIALS|hole in the valence band]] that will create an equivalent positive charge. For this type of reason this is called *acceptor type doping*.
