In electromagnetism we are considering four different vector fields:

1. **Electric Field  $\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}, t)$**
   Its dimension is volts per centimeter (V/cm), representing the force per unit charge exerted by an electric charge.

2. **Magnetic Field $\mathbf{H}(\mathbf{r}, t)$**  
   Measured in amperes per centimeter (A/cm), it represents the magnetic field generated by moving electric charges (current).

3. **Dielectric Displacement Vector $\mathbf{D}(\mathbf{r}, t)$**  
   Its dimension is coulombs per square centimeter (C/cm²), representing how an electric field influences the organization of charges in a medium.
   It is deeply linked with the Electric field by this relation:
   $$\mathbf{D} = \varepsilon_0 \mathbf{E} + \mathbf{P}
$$

4. **Magnetic Induction Vector $\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r}, t)$**  
   - Measured in Webers per square centimeter (Wb/cm²) or tesla (T), it represents the magnetic flux density, indicating the strength of the magnetic field in a medium.

Those four vector fields satisfies the Maxwell equations. If you want further knowledge on the mathematics of $\nabla$ click [[NABLA OPERATOR AND IT'S OPERATIONS|here]].

# Definitions of $\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{r}, t)$ and $\rho$

In the context of Maxwell's equations, the terms $\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{r}, t)$ and $\rho(\mathbf{r}, t)$ represent the current density and charge density, respectively.

- $\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{r}, t)$ is the **current density** at position $\mathbf{r}$ and time $t$. It is a vector field that describes the flow of electric charge per unit area in a given material. The current density is measured in amperes per square centimeter (A/cm²). Depending on the material, it may consist of different components:
  - **Conduction current density** $\mathbf{J}_{\text{cond}}$, due to the movement of free charges excited by the presence of an electric field.
  - **Diffusion current density** $\mathbf{J}_{\text{diff}}$, associated with spatial variations of free charge concentrations in the material.
  - **Impressed current density** $\mathbf{J}_{\text{imp}}$, representing the presence of external current sources.

- $\rho(\mathbf{r}, t)$ is the **charge density** at position $\mathbf{r}$ and time $t$. It represents the amount of electric charge per unit volume and is measured in coulombs per cubic centimeter (C/cm³). The charge density $\rho$ describes the distribution of electric charge within a material or space.

# Constitutive Relations

In the context of Maxwell's equations, **constitutive relations** provide the necessary links between the electric and magnetic fields and the material properties they interact with. These relations describe how electric and magnetic fields $\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ are connected to the electric displacement $\mathbf{D}$ and the magnetic field $\mathbf{H}$, respectively. These connections depend on the material properties, such as permittivity and permeability, and can vary depending on whether the material is a vacuum, dielectric, or a more complex medium.

In the simplest case, for a **vacuum**, the constitutive relations are expressed as:

$$
\mathbf{D} = \varepsilon_0 \mathbf{E}, \quad \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{H}
$$

Here, $\varepsilon_0$ is the **permittivity of free space**, and $\mu_0$ is the **permeability of free space**.

When dealing with **linear, isotropic dielectric materials**, these relations are generalized by introducing material-dependent constants. For these materials, the electric displacement $\mathbf{D}$ and the magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ are related to the electric field $\mathbf{E}$ and the magnetic field $\mathbf{H}$ through the material’s permittivity $\varepsilon$ and permeability $\mu$:

$$
\mathbf{D} = \varepsilon \mathbf{E}, \quad \mathbf{B} = \mu \mathbf{H}
$$

In most cases, the permittivity $\varepsilon$ is further written as:

$$
\varepsilon = \varepsilon_r \varepsilon_0
$$

where $\varepsilon_r$ is the **relative permittivity** of the material, and $\varepsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space. Similarly, the permeability $\mu$ is expressed as:

$$
\mu = \mu_r \mu_0
$$

where $\mu_r$ is the **relative permeability** of the material, and $\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space.

# Maxwell equations in the General Form

The general form of Maxwell's equations, which are fundamental to the understanding of classical electromagnetism, describe the behavior of electric and magnetic fields and their interaction with matter. These equations are framed using vector calculus and relate to the vector fields of electric field $\mathbf{E}$, magnetic field $\mathbf{H}$, dielectric displacement $\mathbf{D}$, and magnetic induction $\mathbf{B}$. Maxwell's equations also incorporate the effects of electric charge and current densities.

The first of Maxwell's equations, known as **Faraday's law of induction**, is written as:

$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}, t) = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r}, t)}{\partial t}
$$

This equation states that a time-varying magnetic field induces a circulating electric field. This relationship explains the phenomenon of electromagnetic induction, where a changing magnetic field generates an electric field.

The second equation is **Ampère's law** (with Maxwell's correction), expressed as:

$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{H}(\mathbf{r}, t) = \frac{\partial \mathbf{D}(\mathbf{r}, t)}{\partial t} + \mathbf{J}(\mathbf{r}, t)
$$

This equation indicates that both a time-varying electric displacement field and an electric current can generate a circulating magnetic field. The current density $\mathbf{J}$ represents the flow of electric charges, while the time derivative of $\mathbf{D}$ introduces the concept of displacement current, which becomes significant when electric fields vary with time.

The third equation is **Gauss's law for electricity**, given as:

$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{D}(\mathbf{r}, t) = \rho(\mathbf{r}, t)
$$

This equation expresses the relationship between the electric displacement field $\mathbf{D}$ and the free electric charge density $\rho$. It essentially states that the net flux of the electric displacement field through a closed surface is equal to the total free charge enclosed by that surface.

The fourth equation is **Gauss's law for magnetism**, written as:

$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r}, t) = 0
$$

This equation reveals that magnetic monopoles do not exist; in other words, the net magnetic flux through a closed surface is always zero. This means that magnetic field lines are continuous and form closed loops without a beginning or an end.

Together, these four equations form the backbone of classical electromagnetism, encompassing the behaviors of electric and magnetic fields in various scenarios, including in vacuum and in the presence of materials. Maxwell's equations are complemented by constitutive relations, which provide the material-dependent links between the fields, such as $\mathbf{D} = \varepsilon \mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{B} = \mu \mathbf{H}$, where $\varepsilon$ and $\mu$ are the material's permittivity and permeability, respectively.
